## Task Description
It is undeniable that the cost of running a business is not cheap and a significant contributing factor for most companies is the cost of advertising/ marketing. Comapnies spend huge sums of money in several advertising campaigns throught out the finanacial year but of concern is that very little of the said campaigns offer meaningful value for money. A common shortfall of many advertsing teams is the failure to develop a proper understanding of the market dynamics which would then enable them to make appropriate measures to widen the reach of the advertisement/ marketing campaign and increase its success rate.

i. Provide a statistical analysis of the different variables including measures of central tendency and dispersion.

ii. Identify the most important factors in determining whether a person will click an ad.

iii. Provide actionable recommendations to improve the success of the marketing campaign.
